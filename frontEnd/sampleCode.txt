import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import { Card, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';

function MyCard({ id, title, content }) {
  const handleDelete = async () => {
    try {
      await axios.delete(`/api/cards/${id}`);
      // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  return (
    <Card>
      <Card.Body>
        <Card.Title>{title}</Card.Title>
        <Card.Text>{content}</Card.Text>
        <Button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</Button>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  );
}
In this example, the handleDelete function is called when the delete button is clicked. It makes a DELETE request to the /api/cards/:id endpoint, where :id is the ID of the card being deleted. You will need to replace this URL with the appropriate URL for your application.

Note that this example uses the axios library to make the HTTP request. You can use any HTTP client library you prefer, or use the fetch API directly.
